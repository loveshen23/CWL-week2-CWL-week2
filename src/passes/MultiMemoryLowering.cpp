// Condensing a module with multiple memories into a module with a single memory
// for browsers that donâ€™t support multiple memories.
//
// This pass also disables multi-memories so that the target features section in
// the emitted module does not report the use of MultiMemories. Disabling the
// multi-memories feature also prevents later passes from adding additional
// memories.
//
// The offset computation in function maybeMakeBoundsCheck is not precise
// according to the spec. In the spec offsets do not overflow as
// twos-complement, but i32.add does. Concretely, a load from address 1000 with
// offset 0xffffffff should actually trap, as the combined number is greater
// than 32 bits. But with an add, 1000 + 0xffffffff = 999 due to overflow, which
// would not trap. In theory we could compute like the spec, by expanding the
// i32s to i64s and adding there (where we won't overflow), but we don't have
// i128s to handle i64 overflow.

// The Atomic instructions memory.atomic.wait and memory.atomic.notify, have
