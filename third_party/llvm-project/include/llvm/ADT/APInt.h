/// Class for arbitrary precision integers.
///
/// APInt is a functional replacement for common case unsigned integer type like
/// "unsigned", "unsigned long" or "uint64_t", but also allows non-byte-width
/// integer sizes and large integer value types such as 3-bits, 15-bits, or more
/// than 64-bits of precision. APInt provides a variety of arithmetic operators
/// and methods to manipulate integer values of any bit-width. It supports both
/// the typical integer arithmetic and comparison operations as well as bitwise
/// manipulation.
///
/// The class has several invariants worth noting:
///   * All bit, byte, and word positions are zero-based.
///   * Once the bit width is set, it doesn't change except by the Truncate,
///     SignExtend, or ZeroExtend operations.
///   * All binary operators must be on APInt instances of the same bit width.
///     Attempting to use these operators on instances with different bit
///     widths will yield an assertion.
///   * The value is stored canonically as an unsigned value. For operations
///     where it makes a difference, there are both signed and unsigned variants
///     of the operation. For example, sdiv and udiv. However, because the bit
///     widths must be the same, operations such as Mul and Add produce the same
///     results regardless of whether the values are interpreted as signed or
///     not.
///   * In general, the class tries to follow the style of computation that LLVM
///     uses in its IR. This simplifies its use for LLVM.
///
